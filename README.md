# VoiceRecoginitionSystemForBeekeeping
Graduation Project 2 - Voice Recoginition System for Beekeeping (Hardware + Data Collection)

Beekeepers routinely inspect their hives to identify any potential issues.
Detecting problems through the voice of the bees can save time, enabling the beekeeper to attend to more hives.
The purpose of this project is to collect voice data from bee hives and enable the beekeeper to define the current status of the hive via the mobile application.
